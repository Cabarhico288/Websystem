      <h3>DATABASE MANAGEMENT</h3>
      <p>A database is a program that stores and manages data. An IT job might include a need for data entry or database use, so it's important to know the basics. Database management requires detail and accuracy. It also normally requires the ability to read and use Standard Query Language (SQL).</p>

      <h3>TEXT EDITORS</h3>
      <p>Text editors are programs that enable the opening, viewing, and editing of plain text files. Because text editors do not add formatting to text, like word processing programs do, programmers can use text editors to easily write and edit in programming and markup languages. In addition, text editors help programmers create documentation files and maintain configuration files.</p>

      <h3>CRETIVITY</h3>
      <p>Creativity is a useful skill for IT jobs because it leads to revolutionary ideas and solutions. You may need to come up with a new idea to improve a process or find an innovative way to fix a technological issue. An employer may also task you with figuring out how to use technology to help the company grow.</p>

      <h3>CLOUD COMPUTING</h3>
      <p>Cloud computing is experiencing explosive growth, as cloud developers are needed for all businesses who wish to migrate their environments, storage, and digital assets to the cloud. And, as businesses rely more heavily on data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, work in the cloud becomes even more important since algorithms and models consume significant resources. The result of these business transitions and needs is that cloud engineers and developers, as well as cloud-savvy programmers, are in high demand.</p>
